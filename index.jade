				h1 About

				p.about-lead Thanks for dropping in to my corner of utopia. I started Borja Design as a personal outlet for creative growth. I work freelance in photography, graphic design and front end development. My goal is creating visual concepts in graphic designs and web development for local businesses around Los Angeles. As you grow, I grow, too.

				h1 Photography
				p.photo-lead Iâ€™m an ardent fanatic when it comes to photography. As a photographer, capturing light in a box, filled with whimsy and artistically composed is what I strive for.

				p.graphics-lead Creating media and concept designs for start up businesses around Los Angeles is my goal. As you grow, I grow, too. Moreover, staying active within my community and remaining active on social networks adds a way of expressing my vision through visual art and web design.

				h1 My Videos
				p.video-lead As you can see, I do love the Venice Canals. I love a good movie, too. However, this ain't it. I was wandering around my favorite part of the westside of Los Angeles. Venice beach and all its denizens.  In the meantime, consider this as a moment of zen. I'm sure Alan Watts would agree while vaping with Siddhartha.

				h1 That's It
				p At least for now until I find new ways to break the internet, or my website at least. This is after all, beta .01 version. Not to worry. I will keep putting stuff up and tearing it down.  Thanks for dropping in.  Until then, Keep on Hacking.
